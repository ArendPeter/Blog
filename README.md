This repo is a backup of my arendpeter.com website

It's a blog of many of my old projects, but I took it down since I didn't want to pay the hostgator fee anymore

At somepoint I want to convert this into a github pages site

The site should continue to be live until at least until late 2025 but I've included a video to have it available in the mean time
